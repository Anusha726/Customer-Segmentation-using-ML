Problem Statement : You own the mall and want to understand the customers like who can be easily converge [Target Customers] so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.

Ouput:
cluster-1 (Orange Color) -> Customers with average income and spending score [Middle class customers]
Cluster-2 (Green Color) -> Customer earning high but spending less [Conservative spenders]
